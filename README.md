# Ma-avar-Balancing-Code

# Segway Project

The Segway Project was a high school senior project (known as Ma'avar at my high school) to design and manufacture a custom Segway balancing robot. 

The project was conducted from beginning to finish in 6 weeks in the Spring of 2018. 

This repository contains the code written for the custom Segway Robot to balance with a rider. The code is run on an Arduino, using a PID Control library with the error angle from an accelerator and gyroscope reading and the resulting motor values passed through a low pass filter. The Segway turns using a potentiometer attached to the steering mast.  

The completed code run on the robot can be found in the SegwayCode.ino file. Further code implementing buttons for further safety precautions on the robot can be found in the SegwayCodeButtonTest.ino file.

The other files were used to test the various components, including the potentiometer, accelerator, gyroscope, and motors, in separate files before combining them into the final code.
